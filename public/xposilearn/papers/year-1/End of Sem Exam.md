# Part B — Short Answer (40 marks; 8 × 5 marks)

1. **PA Wrist Positioning & Evaluation:**  
   Outline patient positioning, CR, collimation, and three key image evaluation criteria indicating a successful PA wrist.

2. **Lateral Wrist Errors:**  
   Describe three common positioning errors on a lateral wrist and their radiographic appearance. For each, state how to correct it.

3. **Scaphoid Series Rationale:**  
   Explain the rationale for ulnar deviation and Stecher methods in detecting scaphoid fractures, including effects on foreshortening and joint space visualization.

4. **Radiation Protection:**  
   List five practical steps to minimize patient dose during upper limb radiography without compromising diagnostic quality.

5. **Exposure Adaptation:**  
   A 70-kg adult wrist study done PA, oblique, and lateral appears noisy. Suggest parameter changes and workflow adjustments to improve SNR while maintaining ALARA.

6. **Image Critique — PA Oblique Wrist:**  
   State four criteria confirming adequate obliquity for demonstrating the trapezium and first CMC joint with minimal superimposition.

7. **Trauma Protocol:**  
   For a wrist trauma patient who cannot pronate or extend, propose an initial two-view protocol and justify each choice. Include modifications for immobilization devices.

8. **Artifacts & Quality Control:**  
   Identify three artifacts specific to digital wrist radiography (e.g., stitching, saturation, motion). For each, note the cause and preventive action.

# Part C — Long Answer / Case Studies (40 marks; answer ANY TWO; 2 × 20 marks)

1. **Case: Fall on Outstretched Hand (FOOSH)**  
   A 28-year-old presents with radial-sided wrist pain after FOOSH. Snuffbox tenderness is present; PA wrist is equivocal.  
   a) Propose a complete imaging plan (views, modifications, and sequencing).  
   b) Discuss exposure factor selection (kVp/mAs, AEC use, grid decision).  
   c) Detail radiographic signs of scaphoid waist fracture and scapholunate dissociation on each view.  
   d) Outline documentation and communication steps when initial films are negative but suspicion remains high.

2. **Protocol Design: Departmental Wrist Series**  
   Draft a standard operating protocol (SOP) for routine and trauma wrist imaging including: patient ID & consent, positioning steps for PA and lateral, optional special projections (indications/contraindications), exposure chart ranges, collimation guidelines, repeat criteria, and infection control. Include a flowchart.

3. **Image Analysis & Dose Optimization**  
   You are given three anonymized wrist series (A, B, C) with varying contrast, noise, and sharpness.  
   a) Develop a scoring rubric (objective + subjective) for image quality.  
   b) Using hypothetical measures (MTF, SNR, exposure index), compare A–C and justify which is diagnostically acceptable.  
   c) Recommend parameter changes and positioning corrections for the two poorer series and explain the physics behind each recommendation.
