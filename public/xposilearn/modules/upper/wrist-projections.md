# Basic Projections

## 1. PA Wrist
![PA wrist set-up](/illustrations/upper/pa-wrist-setup.jpg)

* **Purpose:** Overview of distal radius/ulna, proximal metacarpals, and carpal alignment; screening for fractures and joint pathology.
* **Positioning:** Patient seated with shoulder–elbow–wrist in one plane; hand pronated; flex digits to bring carpals close to IR; palm flat on IR.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm (40 inches).
* **Collimation:** Distal third of radius/ulna, all carpals, proximal third of metacarpals; ~1 cm skin margin.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Carpals with interspaces, distal radius/ulna, proximal metacarpals; radiocarpal and carpoulnar joints.
* **Contraindications:** If pronation not possible due to trauma or fixation, use **AP wrist** instead.
* **Notes:** Flexing the digits reduces OID of carpals and improves detail.

## 2. Lateral Wrist (Lateromedial)
![Lateral wrist set-up](/illustrations/upper/lateral-wrist-setup.png)

* **Purpose:** Evaluate distal radius/ulna alignment, carpal dislocations (e.g., perilunate), and soft-tissue fat pads.
* **Positioning:** Elbow flexed 90°; wrist in true lateral (thumb up); shoulder–elbow–wrist in same plane; palm perpendicular to IR.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm (40 inches).
* **Collimation:** Distal third of radius/ulna and all carpals.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Superimposed distal radius/ulna; lunate profile; assessment of scapholunate and radiocarpal alignment.
* **Contraindications:** If rotation is painful, pad/support to achieve lateral without forcing motion.
* **Notes:** Key view for Colles/Smith fractures and carpal dislocations; ensure true lateral to avoid overlap.

# Additional / Special Projections

## 1. Scaphoid — PA with Ulnar Deviation
![PA ulnar deviation](/illustrations/upper/pa-ulnar-deviation-setup.jpg)

* **Purpose:** Elongation and isolation of the scaphoid to assess waist fractures and scapholunate interval.
* **Positioning:** From PA; deviate hand ulnarward as tolerated; forearm stays flat on table.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to scaphoid (anatomic snuffbox) or 10–15° proximally toward elbow if joint spaces are not open.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** Tight to scaphoid region; include adjacent carpals.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Scaphoid with minimal foreshortening; scapholunate joint.
* **Contraindications:** Avoid forced deviation in acute trauma—use **Stecher** instead.
* **Notes:** Mark “ulnar deviation” on image for clarity.

## 2. PA Clenched-Fist (Stress)
![Clenched-fist PA](/illustrations/upper/clenched-fist-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Dynamic assessment of scapholunate instability by stressing the SL ligament.
* **Positioning:** PA wrist; patient forms a firm fist or pulls against a radiolucent band.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** As for PA.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Widening of scapholunate interval under load, if present.
* **Contraindications:** Avoid in acute scaphoid fracture or severe pain.
* **Notes:** Acquire non-stress PA for comparison.

---

## 3. Carpal Tunnel View (Tangential — Gaynor-Hart)
![Gaynor-Hart](/illustrations/upper/gaynor-hart-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Visualization of carpal canal, hook of hamate, pisiform, and trapezium.
* **Positioning:** Forearm aligned with table; hyperextend wrist (dorsiflex) so palm approaches vertical; rotate hand slightly toward radial side.
* **Central Ray (CR):** 25–30° toward the palm (distal to proximal) to the base of the third metacarpal.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** Tight to carpal tunnel region.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Carpal canal with hook of hamate, pisiform in profile; trapezium and scaphoid tubercle.
* **Contraindications:** Do not hyperextend in acute trauma or suspected occult carpal fracture.
* **Notes:** Use gentle support to achieve extension; avoid patient strain.

---

## 4. Carpal Bridge (Dorsal Tangential)
![Carpal bridge](/illustrations/upper/carpal-bridge-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Assessment of dorsal carpal pathology (e.g., triquetral avulsion “chip” fractures).
* **Positioning:** Dorsum of hand on IR; wrist markedly flexed (palmar surface near right angle to forearm).
* **Central Ray (CR):** 45° caudad (toward fingers) to a point ~4 cm proximal to wrist joint.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** Distal radius/ulna and all carpals.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Dorsal aspects of carpals; triquetral avulsions.
* **Contraindications:** Avoid forced flexion in acute trauma; consider **PA** and **lateral** alternatives.
* **Notes:** Pad under hand for comfort; maintain only tolerable flexion.

---

## 5. PA Oblique — Lateral Rotation (≈45°)
![PA oblique (lateral) wrist](/illustrations/upper/pa-oblique-wrist-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Demonstrates trapezium–first CMC joint and scaphoid waist with reduced superimposition.
* **Positioning:** From PA, rotate wrist/hand laterally 45°; support with sponge to maintain obliquity.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** As for PA.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Trapezium and scaphoid in profile; open first CMC/trapeziotrapezoid joints.
* **Contraindications:** Avoid rotation if unstable distal radius/ulna fracture suspected; obtain **PA** and **lateral** first.
* **Notes:** Do not force rotation in trauma—use sponge.

---

## 6. PA Oblique — Medial Rotation (≈45°)
![PA oblique (medial) wrist](/illustrations/upper/ap-oblique-medial-wrist-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Better demonstration of pisiform, triquetrum, and hamate with less overlap.
* **Positioning:** From PA, rotate wrist medially ~45° (toward ulna); support with sponge.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** As for PA.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Pisotriquetral joint and ulnar carpals more clearly visualized.
* **Contraindications:** Limit rotation if painful—prioritize **PA** and **lateral**.
* **Notes:** Useful adjunct for ulnar-sided wrist pain.

## 7. PA with Radial Deviation
![PA radial deviation](/illustrations/upper/pa-radial-deviation-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Opens interspaces of ulnar-side carpals (lunate, triquetrum, hamate) and stresses TFCC region.
* **Positioning:** From PA, deviate hand radially as tolerated.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** As for PA.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Ulnar carpals with reduced overlap; TFCC profile improved.
* **Contraindications:** Avoid forced deviation in acute trauma.
* **Notes:** Document degree of deviation if assessing instability.

## 8. AP Wrist (Alternate for Limited Pronation)
![AP wrist](/illustrations/upper/ap-wrist-setup.jpeg)

* **Purpose:** Alternative overview when pronation is not possible; demonstrates carpal interspaces differently from PA.
* **Positioning:** Forearm supinated (palm up); posterior wrist on IR; digits relaxed/slightly flexed.
* **Central Ray (CR):** Perpendicular to midcarpal area.
* **SID:** 100 cm.
* **Collimation:** As for PA.
* **Anatomy Shown:** Carpal interspaces more open anteriorly; distal radius/ulna.
* **Contraindications:** Prefer PA when feasible; AP mainly for non-pronating patients.
* **Notes:** Avoid tight finger flexion that might rotate the forearm.

# General Notes

* Remove jewelry and metallic objects.
* Align shoulder–elbow–wrist in the same plane to prevent distortion.
* In trauma, prioritize non-manipulative views (PA and lateral) before stress or deviation views.
* Consider additional forearm or dedicated hand views if clinical suspicion extends beyond the wrist.
